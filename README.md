<strong>jQuery-angular-uploader App : Few notes</strong><br/>
-Disabled multiple file upload<br/>
-Enforced video file format on adding file<br/>
-Drag&Drop is still supported on this version with format forcing: <strong>File format enforcing was not available on Drag&Drop feature.</strong> So I am checking manually<br/>
-App's scope variables change depending on multiple call back events from jquery-file-uploader, which I use to display/edit different components <br/>
